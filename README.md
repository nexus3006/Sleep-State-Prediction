• Built BiLSTM classifier using 146K+ time-series samples with engineered circadian and motion features

• Applied soft labelling, non-wear filtering, and Gaussian smoothing to handle noisy event annotations

• Achieved F1 score 0.66 (no-event) via class-weighted loss, cosine LR scheduling, and dropout regularization
