# Sleep-State-Prediction
• Designed a staged classifier in PyTorch using 146K+ samples with stratified splits and Adam optimiser
• Boosted val. accuracy from 36% → 81% via custom loss tuning, and CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture
• Achieved 0.90 AUC, 0.84 F1(Awake) by integrating LR scheduling, and confusion matrix analysis
